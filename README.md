# Breathing Rate Estimator
Breathing rate at different yogic positions.
We are calculating the breathing pattern of a different age group during exercise or after exercise. We are using the microphone to get the breathing 
signal after that we are preprocessing it using MATLAB at that time we are removing unwanted Noise, and in lastly we can find breathing 
rate per minute. Also, since our signal can fluctuate a little bit, we have to take care of the minimum number of samples we are separating the signal.
An anamoly in breathing rate value can help us predict if the test subject is suspected of any pulmonary diseases, including Covid-19.
